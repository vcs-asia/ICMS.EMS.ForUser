1.	Introduction 
Welcome to the User's Guide for EMS!

Whether you want to customize settings, optimize performance, or explore advanced functionalities, we have included detailed explanations accompanied by screenshots to facilitate your understanding.
Briefing  
A common usage in EMS is almost all modules shall have Index, Create, Edit, Detail and Delete. We call them “Actions”. Every action should have an authorized user to use it. 

 	This icon is to see the detail of a record. The icon can be found with the same row at the end to the right of a record as shown in the screenshot below. 
  
 	This icon is to edit the detail of a record. The icon can be found with the same row at the end to the right of a record. Please check the screenshot below.
 
 	This icon is to delete the detail of a record. The icon can be found with the same row at the end to the right of a record. Please check the screenshot below.
 
 	This icon is to create a new record. The icon can be found at top right side of every listing table as shown in the screenshot below. 
 


Listing Records
Almost all modules shall contain the list of records and this list is displayed in a table as it is shown in the below screenshot.

 

Please notice all highlighted points and its detailed explanation below. 

 
Above every table or list of records on the left side there will be this dropdown option for the user to choose how many records to be displayed in a page. The dropdown contains 10,25,50 and 100.

 

This search box can be seen on top of every table on the right side that is displaying all records to allow the user to type any keyword for searching relevant records.

 
Above line can be seen in every table at the bottom to give the information to user how many records are there and showing from what record to what record and which page is user is ON. And the user is also allowed to click on “Previous” to go to previous page and “Next” is to go to next page. User can also click on specific number of a page to see the records of that page.

 

Every heading of a column may contain above icon which is enabled with sorting order either ascending or descending. The user just needs to click on column header. If the first click is ascending order the second click would be descending order. In case the user wants the list to be normal just need to refresh the page by clicking “Refresh” button from browser.

Let us look at the options of each record. All options here only the privileged user can do.

 
The icon link is to reset password of user. When this action is executed upon resetting the password the password will be displayed in a dialog box. Please see the below screenshots.

The roles can be either removed or added and click on “Save” button to save changes later.

 
The icon link is to delete the user. Upon clicking icon, the user gets the confirm dialog to confirm whether to delete or not. 

 
Once the user clicks OK the user will be completed deleted and will be disappeared from the list. And if clicks “Cancel” the action will be reverted. 
 
The icon link is to add “Student” role to user

 

The “Student” role cannot be added any other user than the student. If the user clicks on this icon for any other user the above message appears.
 
The icon link is to unlock the user if their ID is locked. This would automatically unlock the user if it is locked by EMS.
